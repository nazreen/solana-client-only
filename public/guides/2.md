# Requesting Airdrop

Fund your wallet by airdrop. Only in Devnet.

## Why?

- Your wallet needs SOLs to sign transaction and interact with programs.
- every transaction incurs a fee
- fees depends on the number of signatures
- resources limit per transaction (200,000 compute units)
- Analogy
  - transactions = packages
  - fee for sending packages
  - the bigger the package (more signatures), the higher the fee

## Function
