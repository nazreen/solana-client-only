# Requesting Airdrop

Fund your wallet by airdrop. Only in Devnet.

## Why?

- Your wallet needs SOLs to sign transaction and interact with programs.
- every transaction incurs a fee
- fees depends on the number of signatures
- resources limit per transaction (200,000 compute units)

## Function
`Connection.requestAirdrop(to, lamports)` is used to request for airdrop.
